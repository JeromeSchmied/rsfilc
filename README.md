[![dependency status](https://deps.rs/repo/codeberg/jark/rsfilc/status.svg)](https://deps.rs/repo/codeberg/jark/rsfilc)

## Installation

-   EZ mode: grab a prebuilt binary from [releases](https://codeberg.org/jark/rsfilc/releases/latest)

if not available for your platform ([file an issue](https://codeberg.org/jark/rsfilc/issues/new)), not a preferred method or feels a bit outdated:

-   [Rust](https://rustup.rs)
-   `cargo install --locked rsfilc`
>   for latest, beta builds: `cargo install --locked --git "https://codeberg.org/jark/rsfilc"`

### Shell completions:

   <details>
   <summary>Bash</summary>

> Add this to the <ins>**end**</ins> of your config file (usually `~/.bashrc`):
>
> ```sh
> eval "$(rsfilc completions bash)"
> ```

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>Zsh</summary>

> Add this to the <ins>**end**</ins> of your config file (usually `~/.zshrc`):
>
> ```sh
> eval "$(rsfilc completions zsh)"
> ```
>
> For completions to work, the above line must be added _after_ `compcompletions` is
> called. You may have to rebuild your completions cache by running
> `rm ~/.zcompdump*; compcompletions`.

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>Fish</summary>

> Add this to the <ins>**end**</ins> of your config file (usually `~/.config/fish/config.fish`):
>
> ```fish
> rsfilc completions fish | source
> ```

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>PowerShell</summary>

> Add this to the <ins>**end**</ins> of your config file (find it by running `echo $profile` in PowerShell):
>
> ```powershell
> Invoke-Expression (& { (rsfilc completions powershell | Out-String) })
> ```

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>Elvish</summary>

> Add this to the <ins>**end**</ins> of your config file (usually `~/.elvish/rc.elv`):
>
> ```sh
> eval (rsfilc completions elvish | slurp)
> ```
>
> **Note**
> RsFilc only supports elvish v0.18.0 and above.

   </details>

## Usage

general help: `rsfilc --help`  
creating a new user: `rsfilc user --create <USER_ID>`

### useful stuff

- when in doubt, be sure to check `rsfilc --help` first
- if you'd like to have instant replies, only loading cached data, not caring about latest changes on the server, you shall try setting the environment variable `NO_NET` to `1`, eg. on linux: `NO_NET=1 rsfilc timetable`
- if you feel like refreshing your cache, you'd do (again on linux): `NO_CACHE=1 rsfilc absences`, but don't forget `rsfilc user --cache-dir` either

## Acknowledgements

-   [dependencies used](./Cargo.toml) (although many of them wouldn't be necessary with a proper API, this is **not** the case with e-kréta.)
-   See [ekreta-rs](https://codeberg.org/jark/ekreta-rs), which provides the API client for E-Kréta
